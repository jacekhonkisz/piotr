# ✅ CONVERSION FIX - QUICK SUMMARY

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Date**: November 9, 2025

---

## 🎯 WHAT WAS FIXED

**Problem**: Conversion rates over 100% (impossible)

**Cause**: Google Ads was including view-through conversions, not just click conversions

**Solution**: Fixed code to use only interaction-based conversions (clicks)

---

## 📊 RESULTS

| Month | Old Rate | New Rate | Status |
|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| November | 266% | **90.5%** | ✅ FIXED |

| September | 158% | **10.9%** | ✅ FIXED |

## 🎯 YOUR ACTION

**Refresh your Belmonte dashboard**

You'll see realistic conversion rates (all < 100%) ✅

## 📝 WHAT CHANGED

**Old**: Conversions included view-through (people who saw ads but didn't click)  
**New**: Conversions only count actual clicks/interactions

**This is more accurate** - you now see real engagement, not inflated numbers.
