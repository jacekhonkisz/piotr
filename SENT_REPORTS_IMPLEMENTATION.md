# Sent Reports Implementation - Complete

## Overview
The "Sent Reports" functionality has been completely redesigned and implemented according to the specifications. This new system tracks only reports that have been **actually sent to clients as PDFs**, with a 12-month retention policy and comprehensive management features.

## 🗄️ Database Changes

### New Table: `sent_reports`
```sql
CREATE TABLE sent_reports (
  id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
  client_id UUID REFERENCES clients(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  report_id UUID REFERENCES reports(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  sent_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
  report_period TEXT NOT NULL, -- e.g., "January 2025", "Q1 2025"
  pdf_url TEXT NOT NULL, -- Supabase Storage URL to the PDF file
  recipient_email TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'sent' CHECK (status IN ('sent', 'failed', 'delivered', 'bounced')),
  file_size_bytes INTEGER,
  meta JSONB, -- Additional metadata like campaign IDs, summary, etc.
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
  
  -- Ensure no duplicate sent reports for same client and period
  UNIQUE(client_id, report_period)
);
```

### Key Features:
- **12-month retention**: Only shows reports from the last 12 months

## 🔧 Integration Points

### Updated Send Report API
The existing `/api/send-report` endpoint now:

- Stores metadata about the sent report
- Links to the original report and client

### Automatic Record Creation
When a report is sent via the existing email system:
1. Email is sent to client
2. `sent_reports` record is created
3. Status is tracked (sent, delivered, failed, bounced)

## 📊 Data Structure

### Sent Report Record Example:
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "client_id": "client-uuid",
  "report_id": "report-uuid",
  "sent_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "report_period": "Styczeń 2025",
  "pdf_url": "https://storage.supabase.com/reports/client-report.pdf",
  "recipient_email": "client@example.com",
  "status": "sent",
  "file_size_bytes": 245760,
  "meta": {
    "dateRange": "2025-01-01 to 2025-01-31",
    "totalSpend": 12500.50,
    "totalImpressions": 250000,
    "totalClicks": 5000
  }
}
```
