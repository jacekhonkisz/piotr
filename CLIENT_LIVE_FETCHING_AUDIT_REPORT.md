# Client Live Fetching Audit Report

## Executive Summary

The audit confirms that the live fetching system works correctly for both admin and client users, with each client having their own API credentials. However, there is one credential sharing issue that needs to be addressed.

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ Working Correctly
1. **Admin Access**: Admin users can access live data for all clients
2. **Client Access**: Client users can access their own live data
3. **Unique Credentials**: Belmonte Hotel and Havet have unique API credentials
4. **Live Fetching**: Each client with unique credentials fetches different data

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue Found
1. **Credential Sharing**: TechCorp Solutions and jacek share the same API credentials

## Detailed Analysis

### Client Credentials

| Client | Ad Account ID | Meta Token | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------|---------|
| TechCorp Solutions | `703853679965014` | `EAAUeX5mK8YoBPJSCt2Z...` | ‚ö†Ô∏è Shared |
| jacek | `703853679965014` | `EAAUeX5mK8YoBPJSCt2Z...` | ‚ö†Ô∏è Shared |
| Belmonte Hotel | `438600948208231` | `EAAR4iSxFE60BPKn1vqW...` | ‚úÖ Unique |
| Havet | `659510566204299` | `EAAKZBRTlpNXsBPIbjit...` | ‚úÖ Unique |

### Live Data Results (Admin Access)

| Client | Campaigns | Total Spend | Status |
|--------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| TechCorp Solutions | 4 | 0 | ‚úÖ Working |
| jacek | 4 | 0 | ‚úÖ Working (same data as TechCorp) |
| Belmonte Hotel | 91 | 3,561.83 | ‚úÖ Working (unique data) |
| Havet | 84 | 3,450.43 | ‚úÖ Working (unique data) |

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why TechCorp and jacek show same data:
- Both clients use the same Meta Ads account (`703853679965014`)
- Both clients use the same Meta access token
- The API fetches data from the same ad account, so results are identical

### Why Belmonte and Havet show different data:
- Each has their own unique Meta Ads account
- Each has their own unique Meta access token
- The API fetches data from different ad accounts, so results are different

## Authentication System

### Admin Users
- Can access live data for all clients
- Role-based access control working correctly
- Session management functioning properly

### Client Users
- Can only access their own live data
- Email-based access control working correctly
- Proper isolation between clients

## API Implementation

### Live Data Fetching Route (`/api/fetch-live-data`)
- ‚úÖ Correctly uses client-specific credentials
- ‚úÖ Validates user permissions
- ‚úÖ Fetches data from Meta API using client's token
- ‚úÖ Returns client-specific data

### Authentication Middleware
- ‚úÖ Validates JWT tokens
- ‚úÖ Checks user roles (admin/client)
- ‚úÖ Enforces access control
- ‚úÖ Handles both user types correctly

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Separate TechCorp and jacek credentials**: Each should have their own Meta Ads account and token
2. **Update database**: Assign unique ad account IDs and tokens to both clients
3. **Test separation**: Verify that after separation, they show different data

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Credential validation**: Add checks to prevent credential sharing during client creation
2. **Monitoring**: Implement alerts for credential conflicts
3. **Documentation**: Update setup guides to emphasize unique credential requirements

## Conclusion

The live fetching system is working correctly for clients with unique credentials (Belmonte and Havet). The issue with TechCorp and jacek showing the same data is due to credential sharing, not a system malfunction. Once they are given separate API credentials, each client will have their own live fetching with unique data.

**Status**: ‚úÖ System working correctly with unique credentials
**Action Required**: üîß Separate shared credentials for TechCorp and jacek
