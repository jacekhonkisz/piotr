# ✅ Complete Automated Monthly Data System - READY TO DEPLOY

**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Status:** 🚀 **READY FOR PRODUCTION**

---

## 🎯 What Was Built

### **New Endpoint: End of Month Collection**
- **File:** `src/app/api/automated/end-of-month-collection/route.ts`
- **Purpose:** Automatically fetch RICH campaign data for all clients when month ends
- **Schedule:** Runs on 1st of every month at 2:00 AM (via Vercel cron)

---

## 🤖 How It Works

### **Automatic Flow (Every Month):**

```
October 1st, 2:00 AM
├─ Trigger: Vercel cron job fires
├─ Target: September 2025 (previous month)
│
├─ Step 1: Get all clients from database
│   └─ SELECT * FROM clients
│
├─ Step 2: For each client:
│   ├─ Check: Does September data exist?
│   │   ├─ Yes, has campaigns → SKIP ✅
│   │   ├─ Yes, but no campaigns → RE-FETCH 🔄
│   │   └─ No data → FETCH 📡
│   │
│   ├─ Fetch from Meta API:
│   │   ├─ Get campaigns with full details
│   │   ├─ Get conversion metrics
│   │   ├─ Get demographics, placements, etc.
│   │   └─ Save to campaign_summaries
│   │
│   └─ (Future) Fetch from Google Ads API
│
└─ Result: All clients have rich September data
```

---

## ✅ Features Implemented

### **1. Quality Validation** ✅
- Checks if data has campaigns before skipping
- Re-fetches poor quality data (aggregated totals without campaigns)
- Preserves existing rich data (doesn't overwrite good data)

### **2. Platform Separation** ✅
- Meta and Google stored separately with `platform` column
- Queries filter by platform to avoid mixing
- Each client can have both Meta and Google data

### **3. All Clients Automatic** ✅
- Processes ALL clients in database automatically
- No manual intervention needed
- Future clients automatically included

### **4. Error Recovery** ✅
- If one client fails, continues with others
- Logs errors for each client separately
- Returns detailed summary of successes/failures

### **5. Rich Campaign Data** ✅
- Saves full `campaign_data` array with individual campaigns
- Includes conversion metrics, demographics, placements
- Not just aggregated totals!

### **6. Dry Run Mode** ✅
- Test without saving to database
- Manual trigger: `POST /api/automated/end-of-month-collection {"dryRun": true}`

---

## 📅 Vercel Cron Configuration

**File:** `vercel.json`

```json
{
  "path": "/api/automated/end-of-month-collection",
  "schedule": "0 2 1 * *"
}
```

**Schedule Breakdown:**
- `0` - Minute: 0 (on the hour)
- `2` - Hour: 2 AM
- `1` - Day: 1st of month
- `*` - Month: Every month
- `*` - Day of week: Any day

**Result:** Runs **2:00 AM on the 1st of every month** automatically

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### **Step 1: Fix Current Data (Run Once)**

```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor:
-- Fix NULL platforms
UPDATE campaign_summaries 
SET platform = 'meta' 
WHERE platform IS NULL;
```

### **Step 2: Test the New Endpoint**

```bash
# Manual test in dry-run mode (doesn't save)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/automated/end-of-month-collection \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "targetMonth": "2025-09",
    "dryRun": true
  }'
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "mode": "dry-run",
  "targetMonth": "2025-09",
  "summary": {
    "successful": 0,
    "failed": 0,
    "skipped": 15
  },
  "results": [...]
}
```

### **Step 3: Test Live Run (With Saves)**

```bash
# Test with actual saves
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/automated/end-of-month-collection \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "targetMonth": "2025-08",
    "dryRun": false
  }'
```

**Check results:**
- Go to Supabase → `campaign_summaries` table
- Verify August now has `campaign_data` with campaigns
- Check `platform = 'meta'` is set

### **Step 4: Deploy to Production**

```bash
# Deploy to Vercel
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add automated end-of-month data collection system"
git push

# Vercel will automatically:
# 1. Deploy the new endpoint
# 2. Set up the cron job from vercel.json
# 3. Start running monthly on the 1st at 2 AM
```

## 🔍 Monitoring & Verification

### **Check Cron Job Status (Vercel Dashboard):**

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to "Settings" → "Cron Jobs"
4. You'll see: `/api/automated/end-of-month-collection`
5. Status: "Active" ✅
6. Last run: Shows timestamp
7. Next run: Shows "1st of next month at 2:00 AM"

### **View Cron Job Logs:**

1. Vercel Dashboard → Your Project
2. "Logs" tab
3. Filter by: `/api/automated/end-of-month-collection`
4. See detailed logs of each run

### **Verify Data in Supabase:**

```sql
-- Check all clients have current month data
SELECT 
  c.company_name,
  cs.summary_date,
  cs.platform,
  jsonb_array_length(COALESCE(cs.campaign_data, '[]'::jsonb)) as campaigns,
  cs.total_spend,
  cs.last_updated
FROM clients c
LEFT JOIN campaign_summaries cs ON cs.client_id = c.id
WHERE cs.summary_date >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '2 months')
  AND cs.summary_type = 'monthly'
ORDER BY c.company_name, cs.summary_date DESC, cs.platform;
```

## 🎯 Benefits

### **Before This System:**
- ❌ Manual backfill needed for each month
- ❌ August/September had poor quality data
- ❌ New clients needed manual setup
- ❌ Data inconsistent across months
- ❌ Platform field was NULL

### **After This System:**
- ✅ Automatic data collection every month
- ✅ All months have rich campaign details
- ✅ New clients automatically included
- ✅ Consistent quality across all months
- ✅ Platform properly tagged
- ✅ Zero manual intervention needed

---

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### **Manual Trigger for Testing:**

```bash
# Trigger for specific month
curl -X POST https://yourapp.vercel.app/api/automated/end-of-month-collection \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"targetMonth": "2025-07"}'
```

### **Check What Would Happen (Dry Run):**

```bash
# See what would be processed without saving
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/automated/end-of-month-collection \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"targetMonth": "2025-09", "dryRun": true}' | jq
```

### **Force Re-fetch All Clients:**

Currently, the endpoint skips clients with rich data. If you want to re-fetch everything:

```sql
-- Temporarily set campaign_data to NULL to trigger re-fetch
UPDATE campaign_summaries 
SET campaign_data = NULL 
WHERE summary_date = '2025-09-01';

-- Then run the endpoint
-- It will detect poor quality and re-fetch
```
