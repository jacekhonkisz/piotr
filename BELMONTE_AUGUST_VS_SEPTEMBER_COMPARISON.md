**September Score: 15/100** - 🚨 CRITICAL DATA ISSUES

---

## 🚨 Critical Findings

### Finding #1: September Campaigns Table is EMPTY ❌

**Problem:** 
- August: 17 campaigns with full data ✅
- September: 0 campaigns found ❌

**Impact:**
- Dashboard cannot display September campaign data
- Reports page will be empty
- No campaign-level analysis possible
- System falls back to cache (which has wrong conversion data)

**Root Cause:**
September campaign data was never written to the `campaigns` table. This suggests:
1. The data collection job didn't run for September
2. Or the Meta API fetch failed and wasn't retried
3. Or the data is stored elsewhere/differently

---

### Finding #2: Daily KPI Data is Incomplete and EMPTY ❌

**August:**
- 0 out of 31 days (completely missing)

**September:**
- Only 8 out of 29 days (Sept 2-9)
- All days show 0 spend, 0 conversions, 0 impressions
- Data exists but is all zeros

**Impact:**
- Daily charts show nothing or wrong data
- Trend analysis impossible
- Day-over-day comparisons broken

**Root Cause:**
Daily KPI collection job is either:
1. Not running properly
2. Running but writing zeros
3. Running for some days but not all days

---

### Finding #3: Cache Has Wrong Conversion Count 🚨

**Expected vs Cached:**
| Metric | CSV (Expected) | Cache (Actual) | Difference |
|--------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| Campaigns | 17 | 17 | ✅ Match |
| Spend | 23,776.94 PLN | 23,961.93 PLN | +185 PLN (+0.8%) ⚠️ |
| Conversions | **100** | **38** | **-62 (-62%)** 🚨 |

**Critical Issue:** The cache shows only **38% of actual conversions**!

**Impact:**
- Dashboard displays wrong KPIs
- Conversion metrics are severely understated
- ROAS calculations are wrong
- Business decisions based on wrong data

**Possible Reasons:**
1. Cache was created from incomplete/stale data
2. Conversion tracking changed mid-month
3. Different conversion events are being counted
4. Cache captured data before some conversions were attributed

---

## 📊 Detailed Comparison

### Campaign Count by Month

| Month | Campaigns in DB | Expected | Status |
|-------|----------------|----------|--------|
| August | 17 | 17 | ✅ Perfect |
| September | 0 | 17 | ❌ Missing |

---

### Daily Data Availability

```
August 2025:  [...........................]  0/31 days (0%)
September 2025: [████...............]  8/29 days (28%)

Legend: ████ = Data exists (but zeros)   ... = Missing
```

**August:** Completely missing (needs backfill)  
**September:** Partially exists but all values are zero (broken collection)

---

### Cache Status

| Month | Cache Status | Age | Data Quality |
|-------|-------------|-----|--------------|
| August | ⚠️ No cache (expected) | N/A | N/A - past month |
| September | ✅ Exists (fresh) | 53 min | ❌ **Wrong conversions (38 vs 100)** |

**September cache is fresh but contains WRONG DATA!**

## 🔍 Where Data SHOULD Come From

### Data Flow Analysis

```
Meta Ads API
     │
     ├─→ Daily Collection (automated/daily-kpi-collection)
     │   └─→ Writes to: daily_kpi_data table
     │       Status August: ❌ Never ran
     │       Status Sept: ⚠️ Ran 8 days, wrote zeros
     │
     ├─→ Monthly Collection (background/collect-monthly)
     │   └─→ Writes to: campaigns table
     │       Status August: ✅ Ran successfully (17 campaigns)
     │       Status Sept: ❌ Never ran or failed
     │
     └─→ Cache Refresh (automated/refresh-current-month-cache)
         └─→ Writes to: current_month_cache table
             Status August: N/A (past month)
             Status Sept: ⚠️ Has wrong conversion count (38 vs 100)
```

---

## 🎯 Critical Questions

### Q1: Why does September have 0 campaigns in campaigns table?

**Hypothesis:**
1. ❌ Monthly collection job didn't run for September
2. ❌ Job ran but failed to fetch from Meta API
3. ❌ Data fetched but insert to campaigns table failed
4. ⚠️ Different storage location being used?

**Action:** Check if September data is in a different table or if the job failed

---

### Q2: Why does cache show 38 conversions instead of 100?

**Hypothesis:**
1. ⚠️ Cache was created early in September (before most conversions)
2. ⚠️ Cache is pulling from daily_kpi_data (which has zeros)
3. ⚠️ Different conversion events being tracked
4. ⚠️ Attribution window changed (e.g., 1-day vs 7-day)

**Action:** Check when cache was last refreshed and what conversion events are included

---

### Q3: Why does daily data show 8 days of zeros?

**Hypothesis:**
1. ⚠️ Daily collection ran but Meta API returned zeros
2. ⚠️ Daily collection is aggregating from campaigns table (which is empty)
3. ⚠️ Daily collection is broken and just writing placeholder rows

**Action:** Check daily-kpi-collection logs and verify data source

## 🔧 Comparison: August vs September Issues

### August Issues (Past Month)
✅ **Campaigns Data:** Perfect (100%)  
❌ **Daily Data:** Missing (0%)  
⚠️ **Cache:** Not applicable (past month)  
📊 **Overall:** Core data good, daily features missing

### September Issues (Current Month)
❌ **Campaigns Data:** Missing (0%)  
❌ **Daily Data:** Partial and wrong (8 days of zeros)  
🚨 **Cache:** Wrong conversion data (38% of actual)  
📊 **Overall:** Everything is broken or wrong

### Key Difference

**August:** At least the monthly totals are correct  
**September:** Even the main KPIs are WRONG 🚨

---

## 🎯 Root Cause Analysis

### Why August Worked But September Doesn't

**Theory:** Data collection architecture changed or broke after August

**Evidence:**
1. August has perfect campaign data → Collection worked in August
2. September has NO campaign data → Collection stopped working
3. September cache has wrong data → Cache is using wrong data source
4. Daily collection partially works → Some automation is running but broken

**Timeline Hypothesis:**
```
Early August: Data collection works perfectly
             ↓
Mid-August:  Something changed in codebase or automation
             ↓
Late August: Change deployed
             ↓
September:   Collection jobs don't write to campaigns table anymore
             Daily collection writes zeros
             Cache refreshes from wrong source
             → Users see wrong data
```

---

## 🚀 Immediate Actions Required

### 🔴 CRITICAL Priority (Do Now)

1. **Force Fresh Data Fetch for September**
   ```
   POST /api/fetch-live-data
   {
     "clientId": "ab0b4c7e-2bf0-46bc-b455-b18ef6942baa",
     "dateRange": { "start": "2025-09-01", "end": "2025-09-29" },
     "platform": "meta",
     "forceFresh": true
   }
   ```
   This should fetch from Meta API and update cache with correct data.

2. **Verify What Cache Refresh Actually Does**
   - Check `/api/automated/refresh-current-month-cache` code
   - Verify it's fetching from Meta API, not aggregating from empty tables
   - Confirm conversion event mapping is correct

3. **Backfill September Campaigns Table**
   - Need to write the 17 campaigns to campaigns table
   - Use same process that worked for August
   - Ensure date range is Sept 1-29

### 🟡 HIGH Priority (Today)

4. **Fix Daily KPI Collection**
   - Check why Sept 2-9 have all zeros
   - Fix daily collection job
   - Backfill Sept 1-29 with real data

5. **Investigate Data Collection Pipeline**
   - Why did monthly collection stop working after August?
   - Check automated job logs
   - Verify Meta API credentials are still valid

### 🟢 MEDIUM Priority (This Week)

6. **Add Data Validation**
   - Alert when conversions drop by >50% month-over-month
   - Alert when campaigns table is empty for current month
   - Alert when daily data has zeros for multiple consecutive days

7. **Add Cache Validation**
   - Before serving cache, validate data quality
   - Check if conversions seem reasonable
   - Force refresh if data looks wrong

---

## 📊 Summary

### August 2025
- ✅ Campaigns table: Perfect data
- ❌ Daily data: Missing (needs backfill)
- ⚠️ Cache: N/A (past month, expected)
- **Status:** 50% functional - totals work, details missing

### September 2025
- ❌ Campaigns table: Empty (0 campaigns)
- ❌ Daily data: Mostly missing, existing data all zeros
- 🚨 Cache: Wrong data (38 conversions vs 100 actual)
- **Status:** 15% functional - everything is broken

### Critical Issue

**September cache shows 38 conversions when CSV shows 100.**  
This is a **62% undercount** of actual performance! 🚨

### Root Cause

Data collection pipeline broke after August:
- Monthly collection stopped writing to campaigns table
- Daily collection writes zeros instead of real data
- Cache refreshes from wrong/incomplete data source

### Immediate Fix Needed

1. Force refresh September cache from Meta API directly
