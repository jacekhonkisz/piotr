# Performance Metrics Charts Implementation

## Overview

I've successfully implemented comprehensive performance metrics charts for the "Metryki wydajności" (Performance Metrics) section of the dashboard. The implementation includes multiple chart types that visualize conversion and reservation stages data from the "Konwersje i Etapy Rezerwacji" (Conversions and Reservation Stages) section.

## Components Created

### 1. PerformanceMetricsCharts Component
**Location**: `src/components/PerformanceMetricsCharts.tsx`

A comprehensive React component that provides four different chart visualizations:

#### Chart Types:
1. **Lejek Konwersji (Conversion Funnel)**
   - Visualizes the complete conversion funnel from impressions to purchases
   - Shows conversion rates between each stage
   - Uses color-coded circular icons for each stage
   - Displays actual values and conversion percentages

2. **Trendy Konwersji (Conversion Trends)**
   - Bar chart comparing current vs previous period data
   - Shows month-over-month trends for key metrics
   - Includes change indicators (up/down arrows with percentages)
   - Color-coded bars for current (blue) vs previous (gray) periods

3. **Porównanie Metryk (Metrics Comparison)**
   - Side-by-side comparison of conversion metrics
   - Organized into two sections: Conversions and Reservation Steps
   - Color-coded indicators for each metric type
   - Clean grid layout for easy comparison

4. **ROAS & Koszty (ROAS & Costs)**
   - Performance metrics with target comparisons
   - Shows ROAS, Cost per Reservation, Conversion Rate, and Lead Rate
   - Progress bars indicating performance vs targets
   - Color-coded indicators (green for good, red for needs improvement)

## Data Integration

### Conversion Data Structure
The component accepts the following data structure:

```typescript
interface ConversionData {
  click_to_call: number;      // Phone number clicks
  lead: number;               // Lead form submissions
  purchase: number;           // Completed reservations
  purchase_value: number;     // Total reservation value
  booking_step_1: number;     // Step 1 of reservation process
  booking_step_2: number;     // Step 2 of reservation process
  booking_step_3: number;     // Step 3 of reservation process
  roas: number;               // Return on ad spend
  cost_per_reservation: number; // Cost per reservation
}
```

### Dashboard Integration
**Location**: `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`

The dashboard has been updated to:
- Import and use the new PerformanceMetricsCharts component
- Process real conversion data from campaign insights
- Provide sample data for demonstration purposes
- Include previous period data for trend comparisons

## Features

### Interactive Navigation
- Tab-based navigation between different chart types
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Responsive design that works on all screen sizes

### Data Processing
- Automatic calculation of conversion rates
- Dynamic scaling based on data values
- Proper handling of zero values and edge cases
- Formatting for numbers, currencies, and percentages

### Visual Design
- Modern, clean UI with consistent styling
- Color-coded metrics for easy identification
- Icons for each metric type (phone, mail, shopping cart, etc.)
- Progress bars and trend indicators

## Sample Data

The implementation includes realistic sample data for demonstration:

**Current Period:**
- Phone Calls: 45
- Leads: 23
- Purchases: 12
- Reservation Value: 28,420 PLN
- ROAS: 2.8x
- Cost per Reservation: 65.50 PLN

**Previous Period:**
- Phone Calls: 38
- Leads: 19
- Purchases: 10
- Reservation Value: 21,500 PLN
- ROAS: 2.1x
- Cost per Reservation: 72.30 PLN

## Technical Implementation

### Key Features:
- **TypeScript**: Fully typed with proper interfaces
- **React Hooks**: Uses useState for chart navigation
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Performance**: Efficient rendering with proper key props
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML

### Dependencies:
- Lucide React icons for visual elements
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React for component logic

## Usage

The component is automatically integrated into the dashboard and will display when users navigate to the dashboard page. The charts will show:

1. **Real data** when available from Meta API campaigns
2. **Sample data** for demonstration when no real data is present
3. **Interactive navigation** between different chart types
4. **Responsive design** that adapts to different screen sizes

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
1. Add real-time data updates
2. Implement data export functionality
3. Add more chart types (pie charts, line charts)
4. Include date range selectors
5. Add drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis
6. Implement data caching for better performance

## Files Modified

1. **Created**: `src/components/PerformanceMetricsCharts.tsx`
2. **Modified**: `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
   - Added import for PerformanceMetricsCharts
   - Added conversion data state
   - Updated processVisualizationData function
   - Integrated component into dashboard layout

The implementation provides a comprehensive visualization system for performance metrics that enhances the dashboard's analytical capabilities and user experience.
