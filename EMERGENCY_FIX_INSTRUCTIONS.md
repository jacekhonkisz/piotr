# üö® EMERGENCY DATABASE FIX INSTRUCTIONS

**Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Critical Issue:** `campaign_summaries` table DOES NOT EXIST  
**Impact:** Complete failure of reports system, ALL historical data inaccessible  
**Priority:** üî¥ **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

---

## üéØ **WHAT HAPPENED**

The `campaign_summaries` table, which is the **foundation** of your entire data persistence system, was **NEVER CREATED** in your production database. This means:

- ‚ùå **NO historical data has been saved** (not just September)
- ‚ùå **All months before October are lost** (never stored)
- ‚ùå **Archival system has been silently failing** for months
- ‚ùå **Reports page cannot load any historical periods**

This is not a "September didn't save" issue - this is a **"nothing has ever been saved"** catastrophe.

---

## üî• **IMMEDIATE FIX PROCEDURE**

### **Step 1: Run the Emergency Schema Fix** ‚è∞ **DO THIS NOW**

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Navigate to: **SQL Editor**

2. **Copy and paste the ENTIRE contents of:** `DATABASE_SCHEMA_EMERGENCY_FIX.sql`

3. **Click "Run"**

4. **Verify success:**
   - You should see: `‚úÖ All critical tables exist!`
   - Check table counts at the bottom of the output

**Expected output:**
```
NOTICE: ‚úÖ All critical tables exist!

table_name          | row_count
--------------------|----------
campaign_summaries  | 0
current_month_cache | 1-3
current_week_cache  | 1-3
daily_kpi_data      | 0-90
```

---

### **Step 2: Verify Tables Now Exist**

Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
  AND table_name IN (
    'campaign_summaries',
    'current_month_cache', 
    'current_week_cache',
    'daily_kpi_data'
  )
ORDER BY table_name;
```

**Expected result:** 4 rows showing all 4 tables

If you see all 4 tables ‚Üí ‚úÖ **Schema fix successful!**

---

### **Step 3: Check What Data You Currently Have**

Run these queries:

```sql
-- Check current month cache (October 2025)
SELECT 
  client_id,
  period_id,
  last_refreshed,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - last_refreshed)) / 3600 as hours_old
FROM current_month_cache
ORDER BY last_refreshed DESC;
```

**If you have October cache data** ‚Üí This can be preserved for October reports ‚úÖ

```sql
-- Check daily KPI data (may have recent days)
SELECT 
  date,
  SUM(total_spend) as spend,
  SUM(total_impressions) as impressions
FROM daily_kpi_data
WHERE date >= '2025-09-01'
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

**If you have September daily data** ‚Üí We can reconstruct September from this! ‚úÖ

---

## üìä **DATA RECOVERY OPTIONS**

### **Option A: Recover September 2025 from Daily Data** (If available)

If Step 3 showed daily_kpi_data for September, you can aggregate it:

1. **Go to your app:** `https://your-domain.com/admin/data-lifecycle`

2. **Or run this API call:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/automated/monthly-aggregation \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "year": 2025,
    "month": 9
  }'
```

This will:
- Aggregate all daily records for September
- Create a monthly summary in `campaign_summaries`
- Make September appear in reports

---

### **Option B: Fetch September from Meta/Google Ads API** (If no daily data)

If daily data doesn't exist, fetch directly from APIs:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/generate-report \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "clientId": "YOUR_CLIENT_UUID",
    "dateRange": {
      "start": "2025-09-01",
      "end": "2025-09-30"
    }
  }'
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:**
- Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_UUID` with actual client ID
- Get client IDs: `SELECT id, name, email FROM clients;`
- This will fetch September data and save to database
- Repeat for each client

---

### **Option C: Fetch Multiple Past Months** (If you need historical data)

For each month you want to recover (August, July, June, etc.):

```bash
# August 2025
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/automated/monthly-aggregation \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"year": 2025, "month": 8}'

# July 2025
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/automated/monthly-aggregation \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"year": 2025, "month": 7}'

# June 2025
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/automated/monthly-aggregation \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"year": 2025, "month": 6}'
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations:**
- Meta/Google Ads API has data retention limits (~90 days for detailed data)
- Older data may have limited granularity
- This counts against API rate limits

---

## ‚úÖ **VERIFY THE FIX**

### **1. Check campaign_summaries has data:**

```sql
SELECT 
  TO_CHAR(summary_date, 'YYYY-MM') as month,
  summary_type,
  COUNT(*) as records,
  SUM(total_spend) as total_spend
FROM campaign_summaries
GROUP BY month, summary_type
ORDER BY month DESC, summary_type;
```

**Expected result:**
- At least September 2025 monthly records
- If you recovered more months, they should appear here

---

### **2. Test Reports Page:**

1. Go to: `https://your-domain.com/reports`
2. Change dropdown to: **September 2025**
3. Data should load successfully ‚úÖ

If September shows data ‚Üí **FIX SUCCESSFUL!** üéâ

---

## üîß **ROOT CAUSE: Why Was The Table Missing?**

### **Likely Causes:**

1. **Migration Never Ran in Production**
   - The file `013_add_campaign_summaries.sql` exists in codebase
   - But Supabase never executed it
   - Possibly:
     - Migration files not synced to Supabase
     - Manual migration required but not done
     - Supabase CLI not used for deployment

2. **Database Was Reset/Recreated**
   - Production database was wiped and recreated
   - Only base schema (from first migration) was restored
   - Later migrations not re-applied

3. **Manual Table Deletion**
   - Table was accidentally dropped
   - No backup/recovery performed

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN**

### **1. Set Up Migration Monitoring**

Create a cron job to verify critical tables exist:

```sql
-- Run this weekly
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_critical_tables()
RETURNS TABLE(table_name TEXT, exists BOOLEAN) AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
  SELECT 
    t.name::TEXT,
    EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = t.name)
  FROM (VALUES 
    ('campaign_summaries'),
    ('current_month_cache'),
    ('current_week_cache'),
    ('daily_kpi_data'),
    ('clients'),
    ('profiles')
  ) AS t(name);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

---

### **2. Add Admin Health Check Page**

Create: `/admin/system-health` that checks:
- [ ] All critical tables exist
- [ ] Last archival ran successfully  
- [ ] Current month cache is fresh (<4 hours old)
- [ ] No gaps in monthly data for last 13 months

---

### **3. Set Up Daily Data Verification**

**Cron job: Every day at 9 AM**
```typescript
// /api/automated/verify-database-health
export async function GET() {
  const missingTables = await checkForMissingTables();
  
  if (missingTables.length > 0) {
    await sendAlertEmail({
      subject: 'üö® CRITICAL: Database tables missing!',
      body: `Missing tables: ${missingTables.join(', ')}`,
      to: 'admin@yourdomain.com'
    });
  }
  
  const dataGaps = await checkForDataGaps();
  
  if (dataGaps.length > 0) {
    await sendAlertEmail({
      subject: '‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Data gaps detected',
      body: `Missing data for periods: ${dataGaps.join(', ')}`,
      to: 'admin@yourdomain.com'
    });
  }
}
```

Add to `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/automated/verify-database-health",
      "schedule": "0 9 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### **4. Enable Supabase Database Backups**

1. Go to: **Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Database**
2. Enable **Daily Backups**
3. Set retention: **30 days**
4. Enable **Point-in-Time Recovery** (if on Pro plan)

---

## üìù **POST-FIX CHECKLIST**

- [ ] **STEP 1:** Run `DATABASE_SCHEMA_EMERGENCY_FIX.sql` in Supabase
- [ ] **STEP 2:** Verify all 4 critical tables exist
- [ ] **STEP 3:** Check what current data you have (cache + daily)
- [ ] **STEP 4:** Recover September 2025 data
- [ ] **STEP 5:** Test reports page shows September
- [ ] **STEP 6:** (Optional) Recover older months if needed
- [ ] **STEP 7:** Set up monitoring to prevent recurrence
- [ ] **STEP 8:** Enable database backups
- [ ] **STEP 9:** Document migration process for team
- [ ] **STEP 10:** Schedule monthly data audits

---

## üÜò **IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG**

### **Error: "relation already exists"**
- **Cause:** Table exists but wasn't detected
- **Fix:** The script uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` so it's safe to re-run

### **Error: "foreign key violation"**
- **Cause:** `clients` table doesn't exist
- **Fix:** Run initial schema migration first: `001_initial_schema.sql`

### **Error: "permission denied"**
- **Cause:** Not using service role key
- **Fix:** Use Supabase service role key (not anon key)

### **Reports still show no data**
- **Cause:** Tables exist but are empty
- **Fix:** Run data recovery (Option A or B above)

### **Cron jobs still not working**
- **Cause:** Vercel cron not enabled or misconfigured
- **Fix:** Check Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Cron Jobs ‚Üí Ensure enabled in production

---

## üìû **SUPPORT**

If you need help:

1. **Check what tables exist:**
   ```sql
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
   WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
   ORDER BY table_name;
   ```

2. **Check for errors in logs:**
   - Vercel: Dashboard ‚Üí Logs ‚Üí Filter by "error"
   - Supabase: Dashboard ‚Üí Logs ‚Üí API logs

3. **Share this information:**
   - Which tables exist
   - What errors appear in logs
   - Output from verification queries

---

## üéØ **EXPECTED TIMELINE**

- **Step 1-2 (Create tables):** 2 minutes
- **Step 3-4 (Verify data):** 5 minutes
- **Step 5 (Recover September):** 5-10 minutes
- **Step 6 (Test):** 2 minutes
- **Step 7+ (Prevention):** 30-60 minutes

**Total time to restore functionality:** ~15-20 minutes  
**Total time including prevention:** ~1-2 hours

---

## ‚úÖ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

Fix is complete when:

1. ‚úÖ All 4 critical tables exist in database
2. ‚úÖ `campaign_summaries` has at least September 2025 data
3. ‚úÖ Reports page successfully loads September 2025
4. ‚úÖ No errors in browser console when viewing reports
5. ‚úÖ Monitoring system in place to prevent recurrence

---

**PRIORITY:** üî¥ **CRITICAL - START IMMEDIATELY**

This is a production outage. Your entire reports system is non-functional until this is fixed.

Good news: The fix is straightforward, and you can recover recent data. But you need to act **NOW** before more data is lost.
