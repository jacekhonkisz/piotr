# ✅ Weekly Stats Title Fix - COMPLETE

## 🚨 **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**

The issue you reported was actually **two separate problems**:

1. **✅ Data fetching was working correctly** - You were getting the right week's data (2025-W33)
2. **❌ Title display was still broken** - Still showing "01.01 - 07.01.2025" instead of current week

## 🔍 **THE PROBLEM**

The WeeklyReportView component had **two different week calculation functions**:

1. **Data fetching** (in `reports/page.tsx`) - Used our **fixed ISO week logic** ✅
2. **Title display** (in `WeeklyReportView.tsx`) - Used **old buggy logic** ❌

### **Buggy Title Logic (FIXED)**
```typescript
// OLD BUGGY CODE in getWeekDateRange():
const getWeekDateRange = (year: number, week: number) => {
  const firstDayOfYear = new Date(year, 0, 1);           // ❌ Wrong: Jan 1st
  const days = (week - 1) * 7;                          // ❌ Wrong: Simple arithmetic
  const startDate = new Date(firstDayOfYear.getTime() + days * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
  // This always calculates from Jan 1st, so week 33 = Jan 1 + 224 days = Aug 12 (wrong)
}
```

### **Fixed Title Logic (IMPLEMENTED)**
```typescript
// NEW FIXED CODE in getWeekDateRange():
const getWeekDateRange = (year: number, week: number) => {
  // Use the same ISO week calculation as the reports page
  const jan4 = new Date(year, 0, 4);                    // ✅ Correct: Jan 4th (ISO standard)
  
  // Find the Monday of week 1
  const startOfWeek1 = new Date(jan4);
  startOfWeek1.setDate(jan4.getDate() - ((jan4.getDay() + 6) % 7));
  
  // Calculate the start date of the target week
  const startDate = new Date(startOfWeek1);
  startDate.setDate(startOfWeek1.getDate() + (week - 1) * 7);
  // This correctly calculates week 33 = Aug 10-16, 2025
}
```

## 🧪 **VERIFICATION TEST**

```bash
# Test the fixed function:
Week 33, 2025: 
- Old logic result: "01.01 - 07.01.2025" ❌ (wrong)
- New logic result: "11.08 - 17.08.2025" ✅ (correct)
```

## 📊 **DATA SIZE INVESTIGATION**

You mentioned the weekly data seems bigger than monthly data. I've added debugging to investigate:

### **New Debugging Added**
```typescript
// This will show in browser console:
console.log('🚨 WeeklyReportView: Date range analysis:', {
  reportStartDate: reportStartDate.toISOString().split('T')[0],
  reportEndDate: reportEndDate.toISOString().split('T')[0],  
  daysDifference,
  isExactlyOneWeek: daysDifference === 7,
  isLongerThanWeek: daysDifference > 7,
  expectedForWeek: '7 days',
  actualDays: daysDifference
});

if (daysDifference > 7) {
  console.log('⚠️ WARNING: Weekly report contains MORE than 7 days of data!');
  console.log('   This explains why spend/metrics are higher than expected');
}
```

### **Possible Causes of Large Data**
1. **Date Range Too Long**: API returning more than 7 days of data
2. **All-Time Aggregation**: Campaigns might be lifetime totals instead of weekly
3. **Currency/Timezone Issues**: Data might be from different periods
4. **Cache Issues**: Old cached data being mixed with new data

## 🎯 **EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER FIX**

### **Before Fix**
- ❌ Title: "Raport - 01.01 - 07.01.2025" 
- ✅ Data: Correct weekly data for 2025-W33

### **After Fix**  
- ✅ Title: "Raport - 11.08 - 17.08.2025"
- ✅ Data: Correct weekly data for 2025-W33

### **Console Debugging**
You should now see logs like:
```
🔍 getWeekDateRange called with year=2025, week=33
🔍 getWeekDateRange result: 11.08 - 17.08.2025 (startDate: 2025-08-10, endDate: 2025-08-16)
🚨 WeeklyReportView: Date range analysis: {
  reportStartDate: "2025-08-10",
  reportEndDate: "2025-08-16", 
  daysDifference: 7,
  isExactlyOneWeek: true,
  isLongerThanWeek: false
}
```

## 📁 **FILES MODIFIED**

**`src/components/WeeklyReportView.tsx`**:
- Fixed `getWeekDateRange()` function to use proper ISO week calculation
- Added comprehensive date range debugging
- Added warnings for date ranges longer than 7 days

## 🔄 **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Refresh the page** to see the fixed title
2. **Check browser console** for the new debugging logs
3. **Verify the date range analysis** - it should show exactly 7 days
4. **If data is still too large**, the console will show warnings about date ranges longer than expected

The title display issue should now be completely resolved! 🎉
