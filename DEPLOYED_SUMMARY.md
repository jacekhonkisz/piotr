**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **LIVE IN PRODUCTION**  
**Commit:** 548d6e1

## 🚀 What Was Deployed

### **New Automated System:**
- **Endpoint:** `/api/automated/end-of-month-collection`
- **Schedule:** Runs automatically on 1st of every month at 2:00 AM
- **Cron Job:** Configured in `vercel.json`
- **Status:** Active on Vercel

### **Test Results (Before Deployment):**
```
Mode: Live test for August 2025
Clients processed: 16
├─ Successful: 0 (no new data to fetch)
├─ Failed: 1 (client "jacek" has no campaigns in August - correct)
└─ Skipped: 15 (already have rich data - correct)

Duration: 4.89 seconds
✅ System working as expected!
```

---

## 🤖 How It Works

### **Every 1st of the Month at 2:00 AM:**

1. **Automatic Trigger**
   - Vercel cron job fires
   - No manual intervention needed

2. **For Each Client:**
   - Checks if previous month has RICH data (campaigns)
   - If has campaigns → SKIP ✅
   - If no campaigns or no data → FETCH from Meta API 📡

3. **Fetches from Meta API:**
   - Get all campaigns with full details
   - Calculate totals and metrics
   - Save to `campaign_summaries` with `platform='meta'`

4. **Result:**
   - All clients have complete monthly data
   - Rich campaign breakdowns (not just totals)
   - Platform properly tagged

## 🔍 How to Verify

### **1. Check Vercel Dashboard:**
```
1. Go to: vercel.com → Your Project
2. Settings → Cron Jobs
3. Look for: /api/automated/end-of-month-collection
4. Status: Should show "Active" ✅
5. Next run: "November 1st at 2:00 AM"
```

### **2. View Execution Logs:**
```
1. Vercel Dashboard → Logs
2. Filter: /api/automated/end-of-month-collection
3. See detailed logs when it runs
```

### **3. Check Database:**
```sql
-- Run in Supabase to verify data
SELECT 
  c.name as client,
  cs.summary_date as month,
  cs.platform,
  jsonb_array_length(cs.campaign_data) as campaigns,
  cs.total_spend,
  cs.last_updated
FROM clients c
JOIN campaign_summaries cs ON cs.client_id = c.id
WHERE cs.summary_date >= '2025-08-01'
  AND cs.summary_type = 'monthly'
ORDER BY cs.summary_date DESC, c.name;
```

---

## 🛠️ One-Time Manual Fix Needed

**Before first automated run, fix NULL platforms:**

Run in **Supabase SQL Editor:**
```sql
UPDATE campaign_summaries 
SET platform = 'meta' 
WHERE platform IS NULL;
```

This fixes old records so the API can find them with the new platform filter.
