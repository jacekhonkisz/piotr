## 🚀 **METHOD 2: API Calls** (If admin UI doesn't have aggregation)

### **Open your terminal and run:**

**For August:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE.com/api/automated/monthly-aggregation \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"year": 2025, "month": 8}'
```

**Wait for response (should see):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "targetYear": 2025,
  "targetMonth": 8,
  "successCount": 16,
  "failureCount": 0
}
```

**Then for September:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE.com/api/automated/monthly-aggregation \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"year": 2025, "month": 9}'
```

**Replace:** `YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE.com` with your actual domain

---

## 🚀 **METHOD 3: Use Provided Script**

### **Step 1: Edit the script**
Open: `FIX_BOTH_MONTHS_FROM_API.sh`

Change line 11:
```bash
DOMAIN="your-domain.com"  # CHANGE THIS!
```

To:
```bash
DOMAIN="yourapp.vercel.app"  # Or whatever your domain is
```

### **Step 2: Run it**
```bash
chmod +x FIX_BOTH_MONTHS_FROM_API.sh
./FIX_BOTH_MONTHS_FROM_API.sh
```

### **Step 3: Watch output**

## ✅ **HOW TO VERIFY IT WORKED**

### **Quick Check - Reports UI:**
1. Go to: `/reports`
2. Select: **August 2025**
3. Look for:
   - Spend amount > 0 ✅
   - Conversions > 0 ✅
   - Campaign list visible ✅

4. Select: **September 2025**
5. Look for:
   - Spend amount > 0 ✅
   - Conversions > 0 ✅
   - NOT "Brak Kampanii" ✅

### **Database Check (Optional):**
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT 
  TO_CHAR(summary_date, 'YYYY-MM') as month,
  COUNT(*) as clients,
  ROUND(SUM(total_spend), 2) as total_spend,
  SUM(click_to_call) as calls,
  SUM(email_contacts) as emails,
  SUM(reservations) as reservations
FROM campaign_summaries
WHERE summary_date IN ('2025-08-01', '2025-09-01')
  AND summary_type = 'monthly'
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month DESC;
```

**Expected Result:**
```
| month   | clients | total_spend | calls | emails | reservations |
|---------|---------|-------------|-------|--------|--------------|
| 2025-09 | 16      | 77573.37    | >0    | >0     | >0           |
| 2025-08 | 16      | 99671.52    | >0    | >0     | >0           |
```

If all columns have numbers > 0, you're done! ✅

## 🚨 **IF IT DOESN'T WORK**

### **Error: "Meta Ads API rate limit"**
- Wait 1 hour
- Try again
- Meta has hourly rate limits

### **Error: "Token invalid"**
- Meta access token expired
- Need to regenerate in Meta Business Settings
- Update in database

### **Still shows 0 for some clients**
- Check if that client had campaigns in that month
- Verify ad account ID is correct
- Check Meta Ads Manager directly

### **Aggregation times out**
- Try one client at a time using `/api/generate-report`
- Contact me for per-client fix script
