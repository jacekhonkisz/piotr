# üîç Test If Platform Was Fixed

## Critical Check:

Run this in Supabase to see if the platform fix was applied:

```sql
-- This is the EXACT query the API is running
SELECT *
FROM campaign_summaries
WHERE client_id = '8657100a-6e87-422c-97f4-b733754a9ff8'
  AND summary_date = '2025-09-01'
  AND summary_type = 'monthly'
  AND platform = 'meta';
```

### Expected Results:

**If platform fix WAS applied:**
- Returns 1 row
- platform: 'meta'
- campaign_data: Array with 22 campaigns
- total_spend: 12735.18

**If platform fix was NOT applied:**
- Returns 0 rows (because platform is still NULL)

---

## If Returns 0 Rows:

The SQL fix wasn't run. Run this NOW:

```sql
UPDATE campaign_summaries 
SET platform = 'meta' 
WHERE platform IS NULL;
```

---

## Alternative: Check Without Platform Filter

```sql
-- See what's actually in the database
SELECT 
  client_id,
  summary_date,
  platform,  -- This will show NULL if not fixed
  jsonb_array_length(campaign_data) as campaigns,
  total_spend
FROM campaign_summaries
WHERE client_id = '8657100a-6e87-422c-97f4-b733754a9ff8'
  AND summary_date = '2025-09-01'
  AND summary_type = 'monthly';
```

This should show:
- If platform is NULL ‚Üí SQL fix not applied
- If platform is 'meta' ‚Üí SQL fix applied, but something else is wrong

---

**Please run one of these queries and tell me what you see!**
