# 🔄 Step 4: Enhanced Retry Logic

**Status**: IN PROGRESS  
**Time**: 30 minutes  
**Impact**: Auto-recovery from temporary failures

---

## 🎯 What We're Building

### Current State (Basic Retry)
Your daily collection has basic retry:
```typescript
for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= 3; attempt++) {
  try {
    // Fetch data
    // Save data
    break; // Success
  } catch (error) {
    if (attempt === 3) throw error;
  }
}
```

**Problems**:
- ❌ No delay between retries (hammers API)
- ❌ Same timeout for each attempt
- ❌ Doesn't handle specific error types
- ❌ No circuit breaker for repeated failures

### After Step 4 (Production Retry)
```typescript
✅ Exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s delays)
✅ Jittered delays (avoid thundering herd)
✅ Circuit breaker (stop after repeated failures)
✅ Error type handling (retry vs fail fast)
✅ Detailed retry logging
```

## 📋 Implementation Plan

### 1. Create Retry Helper (15 min)
**File**: `src/lib/retry-helper.ts`

Features:
- Exponential backoff with jitter
- Configurable retry counts
- Error type detection
- Circuit breaker pattern

### 2. Integrate into Daily Collection (10 min)
**File**: `src/app/api/automated/daily-kpi-collection/route.ts`

Replace basic retry with enhanced retry helper.

### 3. Add to Health Check (5 min)
**File**: `src/app/api/admin/data-health/route.ts`

Track retry metrics in health dashboard.

## 🔄 Retry Patterns

### Pattern 1: Exponential Backoff
```
Attempt 1: Immediate
Attempt 2: Wait 2 seconds
Attempt 3: Wait 4 seconds  
Attempt 4: Wait 8 seconds
```

### Pattern 2: Jitter (Random Delay)
```
Base delay: 2 seconds
Actual delay: 1.5-2.5 seconds (random)

Why? Prevents all retries happening at exact same time
```

### Pattern 3: Circuit Breaker
```
5 failures in a row → Open circuit → Stop trying for 5 minutes
After 5 minutes → Half-open → Try once
If success → Close circuit → Normal operation
If fail → Open circuit → Wait again
```

## 🎯 Benefits

### Before (Basic Retry)
```
Failure 1: Immediate retry → API still down → Fail
Failure 2: Immediate retry → API still down → Fail
Failure 3: Immediate retry → API still down → Fail
Result: 3 failed attempts in < 1 second
```

### After (Enhanced Retry)
```
Failure 1: Wait 2s → Retry → API recovering → Fail
Failure 2: Wait 4s → Retry → API back up → SUCCESS
Result: 1 success after 6 seconds
```
