# Database Data Retention & TypeScript Issues Audit Report

## Executive Summary

Found **two separate issues**: TypeScript compilation errors in PDF generation and **incomplete 13-month data retention** in the database. The database has proper weekly/monthly separation but **no data older than 13 months**.

**Status**: 🔴 **ISSUES FOUND**  
**Date**: January 11, 2025  
**Impact**: TypeScript errors prevent compilation + missing historical comparison data  
**Priority**: MEDIUM - TypeScript errors, HIGH - Data retention for year-over-year comparisons

## 🔍 **Issue 1: TypeScript Compilation Errors**

### **Root Cause**: Missing Non-Null Assertions
The year-over-year comparison logic has TypeScript errors because `reportData.previousYearTotals` and `reportData.previousYearConversions` are possibly undefined in some contexts.

**Error Lines**:
```
Line 1054: 'reportData.previousYearConversions' is possibly 'undefined'
Line 1054: 'reportData.previousYearTotals' is possibly 'undefined'  
Line 1056: 'reportData.previousYearTotals' is possibly 'undefined'
Line 1056: 'reportData.previousYearConversions' is possibly 'undefined'
```

**Current Code (Lines 1054-1056)**:
```typescript
${cost_per_reservation > 0 && reportData.previousYearConversions.reservations > 0 && reportData.previousYearTotals.spend > 0 ? 
    (() => {
        const previousCostPerReservation = reportData.previousYearTotals.spend / reportData.previousYearConversions.reservations;
```

**Fix Needed**: Add non-null assertions (`!`) since we know these exist when `shouldShowYearOverYear()` returns true:
```typescript
${cost_per_reservation > 0 && reportData.previousYearConversions!.reservations > 0 && reportData.previousYearTotals!.spend > 0 ? 
    (() => {
        const previousCostPerReservation = reportData.previousYearTotals!.spend / reportData.previousYearConversions!.reservations;
```

## 🔍 **Issue 2: Incomplete 13-Month Data Retention**

### **Database Audit Results**:

**✅ What's Working**:
- **Proper separation**: 147 weekly records, 39 monthly records
- **3 clients**: All have consistent data structure
- **13-month monthly retention**: Each client has exactly 13 months (2024-08-01 to 2025-08-01)
- **52-week retention**: Each client has 52 weeks (12.0 months equivalent)

**❌ What's Missing**:
- **No 13+ month historical data**: Oldest data is from August 2024 (only ~6 months ago)
- **No year-over-year comparison data**: Can't compare January 2025 vs January 2024
- **All records have zero spend**: Indicates test/placeholder data

### **Expected vs Actual Data**:

**Expected for Year-over-Year Comparisons**:
```
📅 Should have data from: January 2024 (for 2025 vs 2024 comparisons)
📅 Current oldest data: August 2024
📅 Missing: 7+ months of historical data (Jan-July 2024)
```

**Current Data Range**:
```
📊 Weekly data: 2024-08-13 to 2025-08-05 (6 months)
📊 Monthly data: 2024-08-01 to 2025-08-01 (6 months)
📊 Missing: January 2024 to July 2024 (7 months)
```

**Impact**:
- ❌ **No January 2025 vs January 2024 comparison possible**
- ❌ **Year-over-year comparisons won't work until January 2026**
- ❌ **PDF generation will skip year-over-year section** (by design, due to fix)

## 🔧 **Required Fixes**

### **Fix 1: TypeScript Compilation Errors**
```typescript
// Add non-null assertions to lines 1054-1060
${cost_per_reservation > 0 && reportData.previousYearConversions!.reservations > 0 && reportData.previousYearTotals!.spend > 0 ? 
    (() => {
        const previousCostPerReservation = reportData.previousYearTotals!.spend / reportData.previousYearConversions!.reservations;
        const change = ((cost_per_reservation - previousCostPerReservation) / previousCostPerReservation) * 100;
        const arrow = change > 0 ? '↗' : change < 0 ? '↘' : '→';
        const sign = change > 0 ? '+' : '';
        return `${arrow} ${sign}${change.toFixed(1)}%`;
    })() : '—'
}
```

### **Fix 2: Historical Data Backfill**

**Option A: Backfill Real Historical Data** (Recommended)
```sql
-- Manually insert historical summaries for missing months
-- This requires running background collection for historical periods

-- Example for January 2024:
INSERT INTO campaign_summaries (
  client_id, summary_type, summary_date, 
  total_spend, total_impressions, total_clicks, 
  -- ... other fields
) VALUES (
  'client_id', 'monthly', '2024-01-01',
  -- Real historical data from Meta API
);
```

**Option B: Generate Test Data for Year-over-Year Testing**
```sql
-- Create test data for previous year comparisons
-- Duplicate existing August 2024 data as January 2024

UPDATE campaign_summaries 
SET summary_date = '2024-01-01'
WHERE summary_date = '2024-08-01' 
AND summary_type = 'monthly';
```

**Option C: Disable Year-over-Year Until Data Available**
- Current implementation already handles this gracefully
- Year-over-year will be hidden until proper historical data exists
- No immediate action needed (working as designed)

---

## 📊 **Data Architecture Analysis**

### **Current Database Structure** ✅ CORRECT:
```
campaign_summaries table:
├─ summary_type: 'weekly' | 'monthly' ✅
├─ Proper separation: 147 weekly + 39 monthly ✅  
├─ Consistent per client: 49 weekly + 13 monthly each ✅
├─ Proper date ranges: Weekly (52 weeks) + Monthly (13 months) ✅
└─ JSONB campaign_data: Detailed breakdown available ✅
```

### **13-Month Retention Policy** ✅ IMPLEMENTED:
```
📊 Monthly: 13 months (covers 12 + current month)
📊 Weekly: 52 weeks (covers 12 months + current period)
📊 Automatic cleanup: Older data removed (by design)
```

### **Missing Historical Context** ❌ ISSUE:
```
❌ No pre-August 2024 data
❌ Can't do 2025 vs 2024 year-over-year comparisons
❌ All spend values are 0 (test data issue)
```

## 🎯 **Recommendations**

### **Immediate Actions (TypeScript)**:
1. **Fix compilation errors**: Add `!` assertions to lines 1054-1060
2. **Test compilation**: Ensure TypeScript builds successfully
3. **Deploy fix**: No functional changes, just type safety

### **Medium-term Actions (Data Retention)**:
1. **Assess business need**: Do you need year-over-year comparisons for 2025?
2. **Historical backfill**: If needed, collect Jan-July 2024 data from Meta API
3. **Real data validation**: Verify current data isn't just test data (all zeros)

### **Long-term Strategy**:
1. **Automated historical collection**: Set up scripts to maintain rolling 13+ months
2. **Data quality monitoring**: Alert on zero spend data
3. **Year-over-year testing**: Validate comparisons when historical data exists

## 🔄 **Current Status Assessment**

### **✅ What's Working Well**:
- Database schema properly designed for weekly/monthly separation
- 13-month retention policy correctly implemented  
- Smart PDF logic hides inappropriate comparisons
- Data structure supports year-over-year when data available

### **❌ What Needs Attention**:
- TypeScript compilation errors (quick fix)
- Missing 7 months of historical data (business decision)
- All data shows zero spend (data quality issue)
- Year-over-year comparisons impossible until more historical data

### **🎯 Expected Timeline**:
- **TypeScript fix**: 15 minutes
- **Historical data backfill**: 2-4 hours (if required)
- **Year-over-year functionality**: Available after historical data added

---

## 📋 **Summary**

**Database Architecture**: ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Proper weekly/monthly separation with 13-month retention  
**Data Coverage**: ❌ **INSUFFICIENT** - Only 6 months of data, need 13+ for year-over-year  
**TypeScript Issues**: ❌ **BLOCKING COMPILATION** - Quick fix with non-null assertions  
**Year-over-Year Logic**: ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Smart validation prevents misleading comparisons

**Next Steps**:
1. Fix TypeScript errors immediately
2. Decide if historical backfill is needed for business requirements
3. Monitor data quality (zero spend values suggest test environment)

The system is **architecturally sound** but needs **historical data** and **TypeScript fixes** to be fully functional.
