# ⚡ Quick Deploy Guide - Cron Jobs Fix

**5-Minute Deployment Guide**

---

## 🚨 **WHAT WAS BROKEN?**

```
vercel.json had "crons": [] → No automated jobs running!
```

**Impact:** Cache becomes stale, no data collection, reports not sent

---

## ✅ **WHAT'S FIXED?**

```
vercel.json now has 17 production cron jobs configured
```

**Result:** Automated cache refresh, data collection, and reports

## 🚀 **DEPLOY IN 3 STEPS**

```

### **Step 2: Deploy (2 min)**
```bash
# Commit and push
