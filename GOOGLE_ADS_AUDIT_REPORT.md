# Google Ads Data Collection Audit Report

**Date:** September 11, 2025  
**Auditor:** AI Assistant  
**Scope:** Google Ads data collection system analysis

## Executive Summary

The Google Ads data collection system is **functionally working** but is currently collecting **test/simulation data** rather than real campaign data. This explains why Google Ads data represents only 13.9% of Meta data volume.

### Key Findings
- ‚úÖ **System Configuration**: Google Ads API is properly enabled and configured
- ‚úÖ **Client Setup**: 14/16 clients have Google Ads customer IDs configured
- ‚úÖ **Data Collection**: System is actively collecting data (last collection: Sept 11, 2025)
- ‚ùå **Data Quality**: All Google Ads data is test/simulation data, not real campaign data
- ‚ùå **Historical Data**: No historical Google Ads data (0 records vs 506 Meta records)

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. System Configuration Status

**‚úÖ Google Ads API Configuration:**
- API Status: **ENABLED** (`google_ads_enabled: true`)
- Client ID: Configured
- Client Secret: Configured  
- Developer Token: Configured
- Manager Customer ID: `293-100-0497`
- Manager Refresh Token: Configured

**‚úÖ Client Configuration:**
- Total Active Clients: 16
- Clients with Google Ads Customer ID: 14 (87.5%)
- Clients with Google Ads Enabled: 15 (93.8%)
- Clients with Google Ads Data: 14 (100% of configured clients)

### 2. Data Collection Analysis

**üìä Data Volume:**
- Total Google Ads Records: 139
- Total Meta Records: 1,000
- Google Ads vs Meta Ratio: **13.9%**

**üìÖ Collection Timeline:**
- First Collection: September 2, 2025
- Last Collection: September 11, 2025
- Collection Frequency: Active (daily collections)
- Data Range: August 31, 2025 to September 10, 2025 (9 unique dates)

**üîß Data Sources:**
- `current_month_simulation`: Primary source (test data)
- `meta_api`: Secondary source (real API calls)

### 3. Data Quality Assessment

**‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUE: Test/Simulation Data**

All Google Ads data appears to be **test or simulation data**, not real campaign data:

- **Data Source**: `current_month_simulation` (indicates test data)
- **Data Pattern**: All records created in batches (27, 14, 70, 14 records)
- **Data Range**: Very recent (last 10 days only)
- **No Historical Data**: 0 records older than 6 months vs 506 Meta records

**Sample Data Structure:**
```
Record 1:
   Client ID: 3c6d5ab3-2628-42fe-add8-44ce50c7b892
   Summary Date: 2025-09-01
   Data Source: current_month_simulation
   Spend: 61.9
   Impressions: 7954
```

### 4. Client-by-Client Analysis

**Google Ads Data Distribution:**
- All 14 clients with Google Ads configuration have data
- Each client has approximately 9-10 weekly records and 1 monthly record
- Data is consistent across all clients (same pattern)

**Client Configuration Status:**
- ‚úÖ **14 clients** have Google Ads customer IDs
- ‚ùå **2 clients** missing Google Ads configuration:
  - Apartamenty Lambert
  - jacek

### 5. Comparison with Meta Data

**Meta Data Characteristics:**
- **Volume**: 1,000 records (7.2x more than Google Ads)
- **Historical Coverage**: 506 records older than 6 months
- **Data Sources**: Multiple real sources (`meta_api`, `smart_cache_archive`, etc.)
- **Date Range**: August 11, 2024 to September 8, 2025 (13+ months)

**Google Ads Data Characteristics:**
- **Volume**: 139 records
- **Historical Coverage**: 0 records older than 6 months
- **Data Sources**: Primarily test/simulation
- **Date Range**: August 31, 2025 to September 10, 2025 (10 days)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Test Data Instead of Real Campaign Data

The Google Ads collection system is working correctly from a technical standpoint, but it's collecting **simulation/test data** rather than real campaign data. This explains:

1. **Low Volume**: Test data is limited compared to real campaign data
2. **Recent Data Only**: No historical data because it's all generated recently
3. **Consistent Patterns**: All clients have similar data because it's simulated
4. **Data Source**: `current_month_simulation` indicates test data

### Possible Causes

1. **No Active Google Ads Campaigns**: Clients may not have active Google Ads campaigns
2. **API Integration Issue**: Google Ads API may not be properly connected to real campaigns
3. **Test Mode**: System may be running in test/simulation mode
4. **Credential Issues**: Google Ads credentials may not have access to real campaign data

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **üîç Verify Google Ads Campaign Status**
   - Check if clients have active Google Ads campaigns
   - Verify campaigns have real data and spend
   - Confirm campaigns are not in test mode

2. **üîß Test Google Ads API Integration**
   - Test API connection with real campaign data
   - Verify credentials have proper permissions
   - Check if API is accessing correct customer accounts

3. **üìä Review Data Collection Logic**
   - Check if collection is configured for test vs production mode
   - Verify data source selection logic
   - Ensure real API calls are being made

### Medium Priority Actions

4. **üìà Enable Historical Data Collection**
   - Configure system to collect historical Google Ads data
   - Implement data backfill for missing periods
   - Match Meta data collection timeline

5. **üîß Fix Missing Client Configurations**
   - Configure Google Ads for 2 remaining clients
   - Verify all client credentials are valid

### Long-term Improvements

6. **üìä Implement Data Quality Monitoring**
   - Add alerts for test data detection
   - Monitor data source patterns
   - Implement data validation checks

7. **üîÑ Optimize Collection Frequency**
   - Match Google Ads collection frequency with Meta
   - Implement real-time data collection
   - Add error handling and retry logic

## Conclusion

The Google Ads data collection system is **technically functional** but is currently collecting **test/simulation data** instead of real campaign data. This is the primary reason for the low data volume compared to Meta.

**Next Steps:**
1. Verify Google Ads campaigns are active and have real data
2. Test Google Ads API integration with real campaigns
3. Fix data collection to use real campaign data instead of simulation data

Once these issues are resolved, Google Ads data volume should increase significantly and match the quality and coverage of Meta data.
