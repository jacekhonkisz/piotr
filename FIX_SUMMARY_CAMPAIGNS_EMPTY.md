# 🎯 Fix Summary: Empty Campaigns Array

## ✅ Root Cause Found!

The database has complete data with campaigns:
- ✅ `campaign_summaries` table: **12,735.18 PLN** with **22 campaigns**
- ✅ `daily_kpi_data` table: **7,118.3 PLN** (aggregated totals only)

**The Problem:** The API prioritizes `daily_kpi_data` over `campaign_summaries`, and daily data doesn't include individual campaign details (line 261 in route.ts intentionally sets `campaign_data: []`).

## 🔧 The Fix

**File:** `src/app/api/fetch-live-data/route.ts`  
**Lines:** 209-291

**Change:** Swap the priority order to use `campaign_summaries` FIRST, then fall back to `daily_kpi_data` if needed.

### What Was Changed:

**BEFORE (Wrong Priority):**
1. Try `daily_kpi_data` first → **Returns 7,118 PLN with 0 campaigns** ❌
2. Fallback to `campaign_summaries` → Never reached

**AFTER (Correct Priority):**
1. Try `campaign_summaries` first → **Returns 12,735 PLN with 22 campaigns** ✅
2. Fallback to `daily_kpi_data` only if campaign_summaries missing

## ⚡ Quick Test

After the server reloads, this should return 22 campaigns:

```bash
curl -s 'http://localhost:3000/api/fetch-live-data' -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "clientId": "8657100a-6e87-422c-97f4-b733754a9ff8",
    "startDate": "2025-09-01",
    "endDate": "2025-09-30",
    "platform": "meta"
  }' | jq '.data.campaigns | length'
```

**Expected:** `22`  
**Currently showing:** `0`

## 🔍 Why It's Not Working Yet

The Next.js dev server hasn't reloaded the changes. The code was modified correctly, but:
1. Hot reload didn't trigger
2. The old code is still running
3. Need a full server restart

## ✅ Solution

**Stop and restart the dev server:**

```bash
# Press Ctrl+C in the terminal where npm run dev is running
# Then start again:
npm run dev
```

Then test again with the curl command above.

## 📊 Expected Results After Fix

```json
{
  "campaigns_count": 22,
  "first_campaign": "[PBM] Konwersje | Remarketing",
  "total_spend": 12735.18,
  "total_impressions": 1271746
}
```

## 🎯 Impact

This fix will make **ALL historical months** show campaign details in the reports page, not just totals!
